# Styling-components

Two components - one using CSS Modules (locally scoped CSS - no global leakage) and one just using SASS within a component (global styles).

Just an observation: your Webpack build process seemed a bit comlicated. Even though there's a lot of clever tooling out there some of their APIs are hideously unituitive and difficult to read / setup. I'd consider revisiting it and simplifying it. Keep in mind there's a lot of new stuff coming soon, so you might want to keep your projects light so you don't become too heavily tied into some of the existing stuff that will definitely be improved / simplified / replaced over the next several months. Just my thoughts...

Hope what I've done helps, if it doesn't let me know lol.

And, seeing as though you are on a fat cat 50k salary and an alcohol connoisseur feel free to buy me a little bottle of something for my troubles ;) x
