# Styling components with Webpack and React

This is just a simple demo of three different ways to style React components using Webpack - 

* one using React CSS Modules (locally scoped CSS - no global leakage).
* one using Webpack CSS Modules referencing classnames from an imported style object. 
* and one just importing SASS directly into a component.

All styles are compiled into a single bundle.

This might help anyone struggling to configure Webpack to compile CSS!
